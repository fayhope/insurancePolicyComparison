# Insurance Policy Comparison
A work-in-progress project leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) to categorize and compare insurance policies efficiently. The goal is to simplify policy analysis for users by breaking down complex documents into easy-to-read categories, enabling side-by-side comparisons.
# Current Stage 
Model Performance: The model can label data with moderate accuracy but requires further training and optimization to improve reliability and precision.
UI Progress: The user interface is under development, with plans to make it more user-friendly and visually appealing to enhance the comparison experience.
