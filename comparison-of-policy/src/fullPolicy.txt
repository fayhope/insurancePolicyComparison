It   also   incorporates   an   ‘opt   out’  which   aims   to   promote   good   customer   outcomes.   We  have   opted-out   of   the   ‘proportionate   reduction   of   claim  remedy’   available   to   insurers   under   the   Act.   This   means  that   in   cases   of   non-disclosure   or   misrepresentation   which  are   neither   deliberate   nor   reckless,   if   we   would   have  charged   an   additional   premium   had   we   known   the   relevant  facts,   we   will   charge   that   premium   and   pay   any   claims   in  full   rather   than   reducing   claims   payments   in   proportion   to  the   amount   of   premium   that   would   have   been   charged.  We   believe   that   our   ‘additional   premium   approach’   should,  in   most   situations,   be   more   favourable   to   our   customers  when   compared   to   the   proportionate   reduction   of   claim  remedy.   Our   additional   premium   approach   does   not   affect  our   right   to   apply   the   other   remedies   available   under   the  Act   for   non-disclosure   or   misrepresentation.  Minimum   transaction   premium  If   any   changes   are   made   to   the   policy   that   result   in   an  additional   or   return   premium   of   less   than   our   minimum  transaction   premium   of   £25   plus   insurance   premium   tax  (IPT),   then   this   premium   adjustment   will   not   be   charged  or   refunded.  Cancellation   rights  If   you   do   not   want   to   accept   the   policy,   notification   is  required   within   14   days   of   receiving   the   policy   or   renewal  notice.   A   pro   rata   charge   for   the   time   on   cover   will   be  applied   subject   to   our   minimum   policy   premium   of   £50  plus   insurance   premium   tax   (IPT).  If   the   policy   is   cancelled   at   any   other   time   we   will   charge  you   on   a   pro   rata   basis   for   the   time   we   have   been   on   cover  subject   to   our   minimum   policy   premium   of   £50   plus  insurance   premium   tax   (IPT).  If   the   policy   is   cancelled   and   the   refund   is   less   than   our  minimum   transaction   premium   of   £25   plus   insurance  premium   tax   (IPT)   then   no   refund   will   be   given.
